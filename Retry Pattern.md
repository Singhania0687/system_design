Perfect, Abhishek! Let’s move on to:

# ✅ **PHASE 2: PART 3 – Retry Pattern**

---

## 🔹 1. What is the Retry Pattern?

The **Retry Pattern** automatically re-attempts a failed operation that might **transiently fail** (e.g., network issue, timeout, temporary service unavailability).

> Useful when errors are **temporary and recoverable**.

---

## 🔹 2. Real-world Analogy

Imagine you're calling someone on a weak network. The first attempt fails, so you try again after a few seconds — that's **retry with backoff**!

---

## 🔹 3. Why Use Retry Pattern?

✅ Handle **intermittent failures**
✅ Reduce need for **manual retries**
✅ Increase **robustness** of distributed systems
✅ Improve **user experience** for recoverable errors

---

## 🔹 4. Risks of Blind Retries

🚫 Flooding the system (retry storm)
🚫 Worsening a **rate-limited** or overloaded server
🚫 Waste of resources without backoff

So, always combine retry with:

* **Limit on attempts**
* **Backoff strategy**
* **Circuit breaker** (if failures persist)

## 🔹 5. Retry Parameters

| Parameter           | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Retry Count         | How many times to retry before failing          |
| Delay Strategy      | Fixed / Exponential / Jitter backoff            |
| Timeout             | Max time before failing the retry loop          |
| Retry on Error Type | Retry only on specific failures (e.g., timeout) |

---

## 🔹 6. Retry Strategies

| Strategy                 | Description                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed Delay**          | Retry after constant time (e.g., 3s, 3s, 3s...)         |
| **Exponential Backoff**  | Delay increases exponentially (1s, 2s, 4s...)           |
| **Exponential + Jitter** | Adds randomness to reduce collision (1s ± random, etc.) |

---

## 🔹 7. Pseudocode (Generic)

```cpp
int maxRetries = 5;
int delayMs = 1000;

for (int i = 1; i <= maxRetries; i++) {
    bool success = callService();

    if (success) {
        cout << "Success on attempt " << i << endl;
        break;
    }

    cout << "Retry " << i << " failed, retrying after delay..." << endl;
    this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(delayMs));
    delayMs *= 2; // Exponential backoff
}
```

## 🔹 8. Retry Use Cases

| Use Case                     | Why Retry?                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| API call with 5xx error      | Temporary server issue    |
| Database timeout             | DB was under load         |
| Network request failed       | Intermittent packet loss  |
| Distributed lock acquisition | Lock may be released soon |

---

## 🔹 9. Retry vs Circuit Breaker

| Retry Pattern                      | Circuit Breaker Pattern                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Assumes failures are transient     | Assumes downstream is broken             |
| Helps recover from hiccups         | Helps **avoid flooding** a broken system |
| Retries a few times before failing | Immediately fails when open              |

**Tip:** Use **Retry inside Circuit Breaker**, but **never Retry on permanent failures**.

## 🧠 Summary Cheatsheet

```
🔁 Retry Pattern:
- Use when operation may succeed if retried
- Add maxAttempts + delay strategy
- Use Exponential Backoff + Jitter
- Combine with Circuit Breaker
```
